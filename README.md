Description: This final project submission uses data from The Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Platform for India (SHRUG) to explore the relationship between poverty and a host of predictor variables, with night light data as the primary key independent variable. 

Concepts from the course that are applied to this project include data visualization, geospatial analysis, and machine learning (both regression and classification).
